<p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or hliidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 pound basmati rice</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    <li>5 pods cardamom</li>
    <li>3 whlie cloves</li>
    <li>1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>1 pinch powdered saffron</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
    <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and gliden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
</ol>
