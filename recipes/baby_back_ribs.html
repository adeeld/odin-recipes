    <h1>Baby Back Ribs</h1>

    <p>These slow cooker ribs are the best I've had, short of the actual grilling method of course! They're easy to make by just cooking them in the slow cooker until tender, covering them with barbeque sauce, and finishing them off in the oven. This is what I do when I want ribs during the week â€” I'm eating them within 30 minutes of getting home, and they turn out perfect every time!
